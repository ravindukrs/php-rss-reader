Several of the delayed union elections then had petitions withdrawn or have yet to be scheduled. During the pandemic, union election petitions have declined significantly. According to the NLRB, union representation case intake in April 2020 decreased by 67.6% compared with April 2019.The NLRB initially froze all union elections, while permitting mail-in ballot elections if employers and workers agreed to proceed. The board lifted the freeze on 6 April, after 116 union elections were delayed, and several other groups of workers had petition hearings postponed.For many workers, the need to have a union has never been greater.Monica Luna, an associate at a T-Mobile retail store in Del Rio, Texas for nearly three years, filed for a union election with the NLRB in April 2020 in response to working conditions during the pandemic and the lack of job security as T-Mobile is shuttering stores around the US.“A week and a half after, our district manager started making appearances and we started having union avoidance meetings,” said Luna.Her retail store remained opened entirely throughout the pandemic, yet her pay of $13 an hour remained the same. “I think it’s funny [that] all of a sudden we’re trying to form a union, and the district manager showed up and stayed for the week, was buying us food, giving his opinion regarding the union, trying to give us facts, saying if we didn’t pay dues we could get fired.”A T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email: “We as a company have the right to educate our employees about the facts around union representation so they can make informed decisions.”The Communications Workers of America lost the election. Organizer Tim Dubnau put the defeat down to the anti-union meetings and frequent intervention from the district manager, while organizers were unable to meet with workers due to concerns of spreading the virus.Activists and labor unions and several elected officials in Congress have been pushing for the NLRB to develop procedures to hold union elections electronically, citing employer opposition to mail-in ballot elections and the urgency of safety protections for workers who risk exposure to coronavirus.As union elections resumed during the pandemic, several employers have continued to oppose unionization efforts through captive audience meetings and pushes to postpone or delay elections.Mission hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, has been fighting with nurses working to join National Nurses United, with the hospital pushing for an in-person voting election and to expand the bargaining unit from 1,600 nurses to all nurses, nurse practitioners and nurse anesthetists in the county.The hospital has also argued to postpone the election until after the pandemic, while hiring union avoidance consultants, the Crossroads Group, to hold anti-union meetings with workers and managers through the pandemic.“We’re still waiting for the NLRB to announce who will be able to vote and when and how the vote will take place,” said Sarah Kuhl, a registered nurse at Mission Health’s oncology department.Kuhl noted the hospital is still pushing for an in-person election vote, while anti-union meetings continue, and management distributes anti-union flyers. “Our cases of Covid-19 here in Asheville are increasing and staff members have been impacted, so an in-person vote would be irresponsible to patients and staff.”A Mission hospital spokesperson told the Guardian: “We respect every colleague’s right to decide for themselves whether they desire union representation or not. However, we do not believe unions benefit our facilities, our colleagues, and most importantly our patients.”Rose Turner, organizing director at UFCW local 1529, filed a petition for a union election in Byhalia, Mississippi, as soon as the board lifted the election freeze on 6 April to represent workers at Hearthside Food Solutions, the largest private bakery in the US which packages cereal for Kellogg’s.Immediately following the petition filing, Hearthside hired a union avoidance firm to hold regular meetings with workers to deter them from voting for the union. The vote was scheduled to be held via mail-in ballot due to the pandemic, but Hearthside Food Solutions pushed to hold a manual election and the NLRB agreed.The union won the election in a 62 to 47 vote.“I’ve been with the union for over 30 years. That was the hardest election I ever experienced,” said Turner, citing the difficulty for the union to hold meetings and speak to workers ahead of the vote. “In the end, we prevailed.”Epic Academy College Prep and Hearthside Food Solutions did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/us-employers-step-anti-unionization-104547096.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 06:45:47 -0400</pubDate><source url="https://www.theguardian.com/international">The Guardian</source><guid isPermaLink="false">us-employers-step-anti-unionization-104547096.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yp8fGf7mhb1J_UWGZcqecw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/c9cb0737e72a5afa24d7977740afd0e1" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/us-employers-step-anti-unionization-104547096.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yp8fGf7mhb1J_UWGZcqecw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/c9cb0737e72a5afa24d7977740afd0e1" width="130" height="86" alt="US employers step up anti-unionization efforts as pandemic spurs activism" align="left" title="US employers step up anti-unionization efforts as pandemic spurs activism" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The coronavirus crisis is making organization efforts difficult for unions and bosses seem keen to take advantageDuring the coronavirus pandemic, employers have opposed unionization elections even as workers’ activism over safety protections, job security and wages has increased in the face of an economic shutdown and health fears.But the pandemic has created difficult conditions for workers to organize elections in – something many employers appear to have taken advantage of, despite the wave of labor activism sweeping the US.The number of resolved union election cases at the National Labor Relations Board dropped from 84 in March 2020 to 13 in April 2020 as the pandemic raged.

Previous clashes in 1962 led to the Sino-Indian War of that year.Protests against China have flared up across India following the latest confrontation, with demonstrators calling to boycott Chinese goods.&amp;quot;There is a lot of anger among Indians after the violent face-off killed our soldiers,” Shahnawaz Hussain, a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, told the Journal. “We are a responsible nation, but in a democracy people have their rights to express displeasure and anguish.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>Media lauds Biden's 'fiery' message to Trump	</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/media-lauds-bidens-fiery-message-030357231.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cmgnik6cwuviqcyqj.V2fQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-06/20/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31297/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31298_o_U_v2.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Media lauds Biden's 'fiery' message to Trump	" align="left" title="Media lauds Biden's 'fiery' message to Trump	" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Raymond Arroyo breaks down Joe Biden's confusing campaign messaging during Friday Follies on 'The Ingraham Angle.'&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/media-lauds-bidens-fiery-message-030357231.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:03:57 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.foxnews.com/">FOX News Videos</source><guid isPermaLink="false">media-lauds-bidens-fiery-message-030357231.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cmgnik6cwuviqcyqj.V2fQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-06/20/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31297/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31298_o_U_v2.jpg" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/media-lauds-bidens-fiery-message-030357231.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cmgnik6cwuviqcyqj.V2fQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-06/20/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31297/5eed80c484a08c6cf8e31298_o_U_v2.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Media lauds Biden's 'fiery' message to Trump	" align="left" title="Media lauds Biden's 'fiery' message to Trump	" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Raymond Arroyo breaks down Joe Biden's confusing campaign messaging during Friday Follies on 'The Ingraham Angle.'&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"/></item><item><title>Maryland police chief latest to face reckoning amid protests</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/maryland-police-chief-latest-face-200639729.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/._kgsAfvRzMnQeGqtaxcsg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/04f7ad562365683cb097b277e5a89da5" width="130" height="86" alt="Maryland police chief latest to face reckoning amid protests" align="left" title="Maryland police chief latest to face reckoning amid protests" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;A Maryland police chief resigned this week within hours of a court filing that portrayed his department, one of the state’s largest, as an agency poisoned by a racist culture.

The death toll equates to a death rate of 177 per 100,000, higher than any single US state.New cases and deaths have been declining over the past couple of weeks, thanks to public health measures such as widespread testing, which led to travel restrictions including a weekend curfew being lifted at the start of June.However, tribal leaders fear the rapid rise in cases in neighboring states, especially Arizona but also Utah, threatens to undo their hard-won progress in containing the spread.Complicating the issue is the fact that the Navajo nation is a food desert with only 13 grocery stores, and a third of residents do not have running water, which forces people to travel to neighboring states for basic items.Navajo nation president Jonathan Nez said at a virtual town hall earlier this week: “Arizona relaxed its preventive measures, and the number of cases and hospitalizations continue to drastically increase. We cannot put our nation in the same situation. We will continue to rely on science and data as we fight this pandemic.” A 57-hour lockdown has been ordered for the next two weekends, with only essential travel permitted. Face masks must be worn in all public spaces.“A second surge, a worse surge, may put a lot of pressure back on our healthcare system and our healthcare workers,” said Nez.During its peak, the Navajo nation sent the sickest patients from the reservation to hospitals equipped with intensive care units in neighbouring states. But this may not be possible in future, given that more than 80% of Arizona’s adult ICU beds are full – almost 40% with Covid-19 patients.As Nez reinstates public health measures to avoid a new surge, Doug Ducey, Arizona’s Republican governor, has stood by his decision to reopen for business.The state began easing restrictions on businesses in early May and lifted its statewide lockdown order on 15 May, even though there was no consistent downward trend and rapid testing is not widely available.About 25% of the population on the reservation have been tested, one of the highest rates anywhere. In comparison, Arizona has tested 5% of its population, and nationwide the figure stands at 8%, according to the Covid Tracking Project.“It would be preposterous to think that people going out aren’t increasing the positive cases,” Dr Murtaza Akhter of the University of Arizona College of Medicine told Cronkite News. “One of my concerns is whether people are ever going to take public health emergencies seriously.”Ducey’s critics have accused him of making coronavirus policy choices in response to Donald Trump’s visits to Arizona, with little regard for the science and public health data.Amid growing pressure from city officials and frontline health workers, Ducey on Wednesday said he would allow local mayors to mandate wearing masks in public, but refused to implement a statewide order.Coronavirus cases are increasing in 20 states including California, Florida, Alaska and Idaho. In response, tribal leaders across the US continue to enforce strict lockdown measures even as governors ease public health controls in favor of reopening for business.In Montana, which reopened to tourists on 1 June, the impact of coronavirus remains relatively low, with 630 confirmed cases including 20 deaths, but numbers are on the rise. The state’s eight tribes, including the Crow and Blackfeet nations, have not relaxed shutdowns or stay-at-home orders, partly in order to protect their vulnerable elders, who are revered as guardians of Native culture and heritage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/navajo-nation-reinstates-lockdown-covid-164053156.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:40:53 -0400</pubDate><source url="https://www.theguardian.com/international">The Guardian</source><guid isPermaLink="false">navajo-nation-reinstates-lockdown-covid-164053156.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Ac03S3bpdDTDjQJs_GSlw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/b985dcf1e39728edd60e155785e0ccb9" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/navajo-nation-reinstates-lockdown-covid-164053156.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Ac03S3bpdDTDjQJs_GSlw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/b985dcf1e39728edd60e155785e0ccb9" width="130" height="86" alt="Navajo nation reinstates lockdown as Covid-19 cases surge near reservation" align="left" title="Navajo nation reinstates lockdown as Covid-19 cases surge near reservation" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tribal leaders fear rise in coronavirus infections in neighboring states including Arizona and Utah threatens to undo progress  * Coronavirus – latest updatesThe Navajo nation has been forced to reinstate lockdowns to shield its people from major coronavirus outbreaks outside the reservation, especially in Arizona, where cases are surging.The Navajo, the second largest Native American tribe, has been severely affected by the pandemic with 322 confirmed deaths as of Wednesday – more than 16 states including Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota.

Howard said officer Garrett Rolfe would be charged with felony murder, Atlanta police union spokesman Vince Champion told NBC News that officers had decided to walk off the job and go silent on radios to protest the decision.&amp;quot;This is not an organized thing, it&amp;#39;s not a blue flu, it&amp;#39;s not a strike, it&amp;#39;s nothing like that. What it actually is, is officers protesting that they&amp;#39;ve had enough and they don&amp;#39;t want to deal with it any longer,&amp;quot; he said.In an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Champion added that &amp;quot;there are officers saying they are not going to leave the precinct unless to help another officer. Some are walking off and sitting in their personal vehicles.&amp;quot;The Atlanta Police Department released a statement after Champion’s comments, calling claims that officers were walking off the job “inaccurate.”“The department is experiencing a higher than usual number of call outs with the incoming shift,” the police explained. “We have enough resources to maintain operations &amp; remain able to respond to incidents.”&amp;gt; Earlier suggestions that multiple officers from each zone had walked off the job were inaccurate.

Howard also told reporters that the taser had already been discharged twice, rendering it unusable, and said the officers would have known that.Howard added that Rolfe’s former partner Devin Brosnan, who was also at the scene where Brooks was shot, would testify against his former partner. Howard said that after Brooks was shot in the back by Rolfe while fleeing arrest, Rolfe kicked him and Brosnan stood on his shoulders.“There is an Atlanta policy that requires that the officers have to provide timely medical attention to Mr. Brooks, to anyone who is injured,” Howard said. “But after Mr. Brooks was shot, for a period of two minutes and 12 seconds, there was no medical attention applies to Mr. Brooks.”But Brosnan’s attorney Don Samuel denied Howard’s account of events, saying his client had not agreed to be the state’s witness and did nothing wrong.“The decision to initiate charges by the Fulton County DA’s office is irrational, unethical and obviously based on factors which should have nothing to do with the proper administration of justice,” Samuel said in a statement.Howard, who said his office was able to bring charges after reviewing eight videos of the incident, is locked in a reelection battle and faces multiple civil sexual-harassment lawsuits and is being criminally investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for funneling nonprofit funds to boost his salary.Following the announcement of charges, the GBI — which is conducting a separate investigation of the shooting — said it was “not aware of today’s press conference before it was conducted” and was “not consulted on the charges filed by the District Attorney.”&amp;gt; Despite today’s occurrence, the GBI will complete its mission of completing an impartial and thorough investigation of this incident and we will submit the file, once completed, to the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office.

There is growing concern in Germany over the outbreak among workers at a pig slaughterhouse, which has fuelled the largest daily increase in new infections the country has experienced in almost a month, with 770 cases recorded on Thursday alone. But Armin Laschet, currently regional prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, dismissed concerns the outbreak had been caused by his decision to lift the lockdown in the state. “It’s got nothing to do with it. Romanians and Bulgarians entered the country and the virus has come from there,” Mr Laschet told reporters on Thursday. After his remarks were seized on by political rivals, including the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, who called them “extremely dangerous”, Mr Laschet hastily backtracked. “It is forbidden to blame people of any origin for the virus. I want to make clear that this goes without saying for me and for the entire state government,” Mr Laschet said. The outbreak at the Tönnies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrück has so far been successfully contained. The German military has been drafted in to set up a testing centre, some 7,000 staff have been place under quarantine and the production has been shut down. Altogether, there have been 730 cases confirmed at the slaughterhouse, and it is believed to account for more than 300 of the 770 new infections recorded on Thursday alone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;</description><link>https://news.yahoo.com/favourite-succeed-merkel-blames-coronavirus-135335701.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 09:53:35 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/">The Telegraph</source><guid isPermaLink="false">favourite-succeed-merkel-blames-coronavirus-135335701.html</guid><media:content height="86" url="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QI4e3Mq67wyrQ88QlmBcNQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d810878d413f99e4670419bc1e20ec8b" width="130"/><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/favourite-succeed-merkel-blames-coronavirus-135335701.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QI4e3Mq67wyrQ88QlmBcNQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d810878d413f99e4670419bc1e20ec8b" width="130" height="86" alt="Favourite to succeed Merkel blames new coronavirus outbreak on migrant workers" align="left" title="Favourite to succeed Merkel blames new coronavirus outbreak on migrant workers" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;The favourite to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor has come under fire after he appeared to blame migrant workers from Romania and Bulgaria for a new coronavirus outbreak.
